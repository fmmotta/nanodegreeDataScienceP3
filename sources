I have gathered information to develop this project from the lectures in the Data Wrangling module of the Nanodegree, from the Coursera course named "Introduction to Data Science with Python",
from github repositories maintained by users jianru-shi, agapic and alexxucui and also from Stackoverflow, mostly on topic 19472922 regarding the import of the SQL schema into the database via Python.
